# Crowdsourcing Truthfulness: The Impact of Judgment Scale and Assessor Bias

This repository contains the crowdsourced judgments used in the ECIR'20 short paper titled "Crowdsourcing Truthfulness: The Impact of Judgment Scale and Assessor Bias", for two two different judgment scales: [S6](./S6_data.csv) and [S100](./S100_data.csv). 

The files also include the collected information about assessorsâ€™ background that allowed us to analyse assessment bias.
