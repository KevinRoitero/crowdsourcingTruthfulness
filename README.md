# Crowdsourcing Truthfulness: The Impact of Judgment Scale and Assessor Bias


This repository contains the crowdsourced judgments used in the ECIR'20 short paper titled "Crowdsourcing Truthfulness: The Impact of Judgment Scale and Assessor Bias", for two two different judgment scales: [S6](./ECIR2020/S6_data.csv) and [S100](./ECIR2020/S100_data.csv). 

The files also include the collected information about assessors’ background that allowed us to analyse assessment bias.
