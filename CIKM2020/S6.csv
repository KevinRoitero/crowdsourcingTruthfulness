An Instagram post from an account called âbye_bye_big_pharmaâ says that âCV vaccine tested in patients in Africa started yesterday. (4/8/2020) It was passed without any animal safety studies. 7 children died on the spot after injection.âThatâs not true.There is no clinical trial currently underway in that country, or anywhere in Africa, according to a list of vaccine candidates compiled for the scientific journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. As of April 8, there were 115 candidates worldwide â and while 78 were confirmed as active, only five are in the clinical trial phase. Those five trials are happening in the U.S. and China.The false claim appears to stem from a viral video that shows a crowd of people in a street near a police car. A French speaker in the video tells of a âserious scandal in Senegal.â Sharon Bell, an assistant professor of French translation at Kent State University, translated the video for FactCheck.org.The speaker claims that âa guy â¦ went into a house to vaccinate children against the problem of Coronavirus, the COVID-19. He vaccinated seven people, children. Seven children. They immediately died. They dropped dead.â It further says the police are on the scene.But the speakerâs claims evidently were added to the original video, which told a very different story.AFP Senegal found the video in a late March news report in that country â and it didnât say that anybody had died. Instead, the video appeared in a story about the alleged arrest of two individuals claiming they had vaccines.That video â which is in Wolof, a language spoken in Senegal â does not claim that any children died, according to Omar Ka, an associate professor of modern languages, linguistics and intercultural communication at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.âThe difference between the French version and the Wolof one is that the latter does not talk about children being killed,â Ka told us in an email. âIt simply states that an individual was caught trying to vaccinate people for COVID-19 and he was chased away, finding refuge at the neighborhood leaderâs (Chef de Quartier, in French) house.âKa said that in the beginning of the French version, âyou can clearly overhear the Wolof narrator, but he gets quickly overtaken by the French-speaking narrator.â The French version, he said, âdefinitely is not a translation of the Wolof versionâ â he said it adds more dramatic details, âtalking about seven kids killed and the need in return to kill the individual.âMultiple government agencies told AFP Senegal that one Senegalese man (not two people) was briefly arrested on March 26 in Dalifort, an area in the countryâs capital of Dakar, and that he was selling cosmetics and hadnât actually tried to vaccinate anyone. An armed forces ministry spokesman said the mishap occurred because the man was wearing a health ministry T-shirt and jokingly said he had vaccines, causing a stir. Police found that he only had cosmetic products.One website in Ghana, ezone57.com, ran the video under the headline: âCoronavirus: COVID-19 Vaccine Killed 7 Children in Senegal(West Africa) [VIDEO].â That post garnered considerable attention, and its headline appeared in screenshots on Facebook, before the website took down the story and published another debunking the claim.The falsehood circulated amid news reports about controversial remarks made by two French doctors who suggested vaccine trials should be conducted in Africa.World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus referred to those comments as âracist,â saying during an April 6 press conference that âAfrica cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.ââWe will follow all the rules to test any vaccines or therapeutics all over the world using exactly the same rule,â he said. âWhether itâs in Europe, Africa or wherever â we will use the same protocol.ââThe hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop,â he said.Editorâs note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

But to be clear, that just means the virus was detectable â not that it was viable or that contact with those services would have been able to infect someone. (Editorâs note: RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries the virusâs genetic information.)Dr Akiko Iwasaki: It just means that there are parts of the virus that still remain. The virus needs many other components to be intact. If you have bits and pieces of RNA, thatâs not going to make a virus, you need an entire intact genome. Just because you had a little piece of RNA doesnât mean that thereâs an infection.How long can the virus survive on surfaces?Coronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletterRead moreMarcus: The New England Journal of Medicine just published a study that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting.

They hoped it would stave off a coronavirus infection.âWithin thirty minutes of ingestion, the couple experienced immediate effectsâ that sent them to the emergency room, a Banner Health spokeswoman said in a statement Monday. They felt dizzy and started vomiting. The husband died at the hospital, and the wife is under critical care, according to the statement.Left-wing media publications and journalists immediately falsely suggested that President Donald Trump was responsible because he touted the anti-malaria drug as something that the government was looking at as a possible treatment.To be clear, the president never instructed anyone to take any medication and did not tell people to eat fish tank cleaner.The CDC reported the following about Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquineâs potential use for treating the coronavirus:There are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.  At present clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care, including supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated.  An array of drugs approved for other indications as well as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred clinical trials that are underway across the globe. The purpose of this document is to provide information on two of the approved drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and one of the investigational agents (remdesivir) currently in use in the United States.Trump tweeted earlier this week: âHYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.
