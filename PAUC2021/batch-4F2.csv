(Several factors apply, such as age and health.)As of March 10, 4,012 people around the world had died after contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The death toll in the United States is 28.A study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the virus from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 80 percent of the cases were mild, but the virus had a fatality rate of 2.3 percent. A more recent estimate from the World Health Organization puts the number at 3.4 percent, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals.For comparison, the fatality rate of this yearâs strain of the flu is estimated to be between 0.05 and 0.1 percent in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 20,000 and 52,000 have died.The higher death count for the flu is a result of its prevalence. As of now, the flu is more common in the United States than the coronavirus. So, even though it has a lower mortality rate, it kills more people.""The prevalence of flu is higher at this moment in time,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Universityâs Center for Health Security. ""(But) pound for pound, if you had both viruses, the one thatâs more likely to make you die is the coronavirus.""",https://www.wral.com/fact-check-is-the-flu-more-deadly-than-the-coronavirus/19006800/,1.0,176.59
