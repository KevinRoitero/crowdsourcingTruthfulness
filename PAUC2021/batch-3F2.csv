Importantly, the participants in the study volunteered to be in it, can opt out at any time, and did not and will not have anything injected into them. Another project, currently active in Bangladesh and Tanzania, seeks to test the viability of tying infant fingerprints to digital identities.These projects are small pilot studies with limited relevance to the current COVID-19 pandemic, and none of them involves injecting anything into anyone, let alone something that would contain the functionality that would enable any sort of active tracking or surveillance.

In 2010, 64% said that the U.S. was the No. 1 military power in the world. By 2016, that number had dropped to 49%.""5. race relations: ""Many spoke of Obama's election ushering in a new ""post-racial"" period in America.
