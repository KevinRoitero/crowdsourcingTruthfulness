Regardless, his tweet is on point. The CDC has previously, in a document unrelated to the coronavirus, defined older adults as those over 60. The WHO specifically mentioned people over 60 in its recent report on the coronavirus outbreak in China.It also appears that people older than 60 are more susceptible to complications from the virus.Scientific American reported that patients in China were more at-risk of death if they developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ARDS, after contracting COVID-19, the illness associated with the virus. The average age of those who contracted the syndrome was 61.So we know that people who are 60 years old or older are likely to be more at-risk than other age groups. With this in mind, letâs look at the age of North Carolinaâs legislators.The legislature includes 170 members: 120 in the House and 50 in the Senate. In the Senate, 28 members are 60 or older. In the House, 63 members are older than 60. That means 91 members are age 60 or older â 53 percent of the General Assembly. Those numbers come from James White, the House principal clerk, and Sarah Holland, the Senateâs principal clerk.So, itâs true that a majority of legislators are 60 or older.",https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/fact-check-are-most-north-carolina-legislators-at-high-risk-for-coronavirus/19016699/,1.0,983.98
