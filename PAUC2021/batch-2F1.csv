The spread was faster than governments or hospitals were prepared for. The World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, and the U.S. president eventually declared a national emergency. Before it was over, the pandemic had hit 60.8 million Americans, hospitalized 274,304, and killed 12,469, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was the H1N1 virus, also known as the swine flu, which emerged in April 2009 and lasted until April 2010. As President Donald Trump has talked about the U.S. response to the new coronavirus disease, which health officials call COVID-19, he frequently has brought up what he considers his predecessorâs poor and slow response to the H1N1 virus. âThey didnât do anything about it,â Trump said of the Obama administration in a March 4 interview with Fox News Channelâs Sean Hannity. âInterestingly, with the swine flu, children wereâin particular, they were vulnerable, sort of the opposite in that respect. But children were very vulnerable to the swine flu.ââBut they never did close the borders,â he said. âI donât think they ever did have the travel ban. And we did. And, again, they lost at least 13,000.âThe president rounded up the number of deaths. With regard to the border, H1N1 began in Mexico, but it broke out almost entirely in North America, and thus there was no travel ban. Two months into the current health crisis, there have been 3,487 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States across 49 states, with 69 deaths, according to the coronavirus.gov website set up by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Trump made the comment to Hannity amid heavy criticism from Democrats and left-leaning media outlets that his response to COVID-19 was poor.  Medical professionals say, however, that itâs difficult to compare the ailments or the governmentâs response. âItâs not an apples-to-apples comparison in terms of response. H1N1 was a type of influenza. The development of the vaccine was fairly straight forward,â Dr. Lee Gross, owner of Epiphany Health and president of Docs 4 Patient Care Foundation, told The Daily Signal. âCOVID-19 is essentially a brand new virus,â Gross said. âSo we have had to use technology that wasnât meant for it to fight coronavirus. Weâre building a parachute on the way down.âThe first U.S. case of H1N1, which originated in Mexico, was in California, he said.  The coronavirus began behind closed doors in Wuhan, China, he added, where neither the World Health Organization nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were allowed to get boots on the ground to assist Chinese medical officials. âIâm not sure what President Trump said is 100% accurate. A lot of response for H1N1 was built into the system, but itâs not fair to say the Obama administration didnât do anything,â Gross said, adding:",https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/03/16/a-tale-of-2-pandemics-and-the-governments-response/,2.0,1167.87
