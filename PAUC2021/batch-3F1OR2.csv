In 2009, the figure was 49%.Confidence in the Supreme Court and Congress sunk to record lows in 2014, at 30% and 7%, respectively.Throughout the past eight years, Congress continuously received dismal approval ratings, dropping to a yearly low of 14% approval in 2013.

Americans, however, were no more satisfied with the position of the U.S. in the world under Obama than they had been in the late years of the Bush presidency.

In 2010, 64% said that the U.S. was the No. 1 military power in the world. By 2016, that number had dropped to 49%.""5. race relations: ""Many spoke of Obama's election ushering in a new ""post-racial"" period in America.
