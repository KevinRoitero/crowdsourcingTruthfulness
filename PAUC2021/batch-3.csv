But apparently the novel idea of a vaccine for defeating Covid-19 â the quintessential silver bullet â has nonetheless become an issue of perturbing inoculation. A viral claim which is routed globally says Bill Gates is planning to use microchip implants to fight the coronavirus. Most of the posts being published now say Gates will launch human-implantable capsules that have digital certificates which can show who has been tested for the coronavirus and who has been vaccinated against it. On the other hand, some Americans like Roger Stone doubt that Bill Gates may have created coronavirus to microchip people.According to a claim being relayed on Instagram and beyond, Bill Gates is pushing an effort during the current outbreak to track Americans using bracelets and invisible tattoos that would be delivered alongside a vaccine. The said theory also insinuates the project came along days after Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, stepped down from the companyâs board of directors. It is also interesting to note while giving a comprehensive presentation almost five years ago in 2015 at the TED Bill Gates prognosticated the coming fear to be faced by a virus but not by an atom bomb. âToday the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesnât look like this.

""President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday's briefing,"" she said. ""Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.""Is that what they did? The context of Trump's remarks was a presentation by William Bryan, a senior Department of Homeland Security official who oversees science and technology issues. Bryan summarized the results of experiments that found exposure to sunlight dramatically reduced the half-life of coronavirus particles on nonporous surfaces such as door handles and stainless steel. He also noted that applying bleach ""will kill the virus in five minutes,"" while isopropyl alcohol ""will kill the virus in 30 seconds."" Here is Trump's response to that information, according to the official White House transcript of the press briefing:I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you're totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendousâwhether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful lightâand I think you said that that hasn't been checked, but you're going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you're going to test that too. It sounds interestingâ¦And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it soundsâit sounds interesting to me.Trump's comments apparently were alarming enough to prompt an advisory from Reckitt Benckiser, the British manufacturer of Lysol and Dettol cleaning products. I say ""apparently"" because the advisory does not mention Trump specifically, but it was first posted around noon London time, about 12 hours after the press briefing, which concluded close to midnight for the folks at Reckitt Benckiser. Here is what they said:Due to recent speculation and social media activity, RB (the makers of Lysol and Dettol) has been asked whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route). As with all products, our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines.

Instead, testing for the new coronavirus was conducted almost entirely by the CDC â samples collected at the local level were sent to the agency.Initial test kits developed by the CDC for use in local and state labs were flawed and produced inaccurate results in some labs, meaning they couldnât be distributed. As the agency worked to correct the tests, health officials turned to the FDA.The U.S. Association of Public Health Laboratories submitted a letter asking the agency to use âenforcement discretionâ and authorize local and state labs to develop and use their own tests.During a public health emergency, labs and drug manufacturers must seek an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA to use diagnostic tests and medical treatments that have not gone through the typical clearance process â to share them faster in the emergency.(These authorizations were begun in 2004 under President George W. Bush.)For laboratory-developed tests, like the ones in question, FDA policy has stated that they cannot be used in clinical diagnoses without the FDAâs approval during an emergency.Although the goal of these regulations is to ensure only accurate lab tests are conducted, health officials have said they prevented them from quickly responding to the virus.One doctor in a Seattle lab described the process for getting an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA and said the agency asked for a level of testing that didnât make sense in the context of an emergency, according to a GQ profile.A doctor in North Carolina told NBC News that she had developed a test using the World Health Organizationâs protocol but had yet to receive the use authorization from the FDA, putting the state âway behindâ in its ability to test patients.On Feb. 29, the FDA announced a change in the process: Labs would still need to seek the agencyâs approval for their tests, but the labs could begin testing while waiting for the official green light.On Monday, (three days after Crenshaw made his claim) the FDA announced another change to its policies and put state officials in charge of coronavirus tests developed by laboratories in their states, meaning labs would engage with state officials and not the FDA. It also removes the requirement for these labs to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization for their tests.The changes also expand which labs and manufacturers are included in FDA guidelines and which kinds of tests can be developed.âWe believe the unprecedented policy set forth in todayâs updated guidance, which addresses laboratories and commercial manufacturers, will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the number and variety of diagnostic tests, as well as available testing capabilities in health care settings, and reference and commercial laboratories,â reads a release from the agency.After the changesAfter the FDA announced changes to its policies, Labcorps and Quest Diagnostics both announced plans to start testing for the new coronavirus, crediting changes in federal policy with their ability to do so.âWe applaud the FDA for providing the flexibility for innovative, quality lab developed tests to be brought to patients and providers quickly to advance effective response to the coronavirus outbreak,â said Steve Rusckowski, chairman and chief executive officer of Quest Diagnostics, in a statement.But even as state and local authorities move to ramp up testing, the number of available tests is still lacking.In Austin, for example, there is still a gap between available test kids and demand for testing, as officials prioritize testing for health care workers, people living in nursing homes and people at high risk for complications from the virus.Our RulingCrenshaw said in a tweet that longstanding FDA regulations âcreated barriers to the private industry creating a test quicklyâ for the coronavirus.Crenshawâs statement is accurate. FDA procedures adopted in 2004 meant laboratories had to seek the agencyâs approval before developing and using tests in communities, a policy many health care officials have said prevented the country from taking early action in response to the novel coronavirus.It is important to keep in mind that other factors have contributed to the low levels of testing for the virus, beyond the FDA regulations.But Crenshawâs statement is accurate.

""Whenever you have the threat of a transmissible infection, there are varying degrees from understandable to outlandish extrapolations of fear,"" Fauci said. Government agencies, including Fauci's own at the National Institutes of Health, are being inundated with calls and emails from nervous people, just as they were during the Ebola and SARS scares. Why did US break Diamond Princess coronavirus quarantine? 'Something went awry'Fauci recalled how a nurse who was infected with Ebola took a flight to Ohio because she was asymptomatic and not at risk of infecting anyone. People everywhere suddenly thought all planes were unsafe. ""I was getting calls from people in Sacramento saying, 'Can I get on an airplane to go to Seattle?'"" Fauci said. ""Like, what? What does that got to do with anything?""Other advice from Fauci and Dr. Stephen Hahn, Food and Drug Administration commissioner,  includes: â¢Chinese products. Coronavirus is predominantly spread in the air from humans to humans. ""Inanimate things"" that are placed in a container in China and sent to the U.S. don't carry any risk of transmitting the virus, Fauci said. Neither do medications made in China.  Imported shipments of FDA-regulated products, including from China, are reviewed by the FDA and have to meet the same standards as domestic products, Hahn said in a statement late Friday.""We want to reassure the public that at this time there is no evidence that food or food packaging have been associated with transmission and no reason to be concerned,"" Hahn said. ""Further, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods, including food and drugs for humans and pets, and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. associated with imported goods.""â¢Scam solutions. A real concern, though, could be the fake remedies for coronavirus that have surfaced from scam artists who capitalize on people's fears. Hahn said the FDA has set up a cross-agency task force to closely monitor for fraudulent products and false product claims about coronavirus.The agency has asked major retailers to monitor their ""online marketplaces"" for such products, which are subject to FDA investigation and potential enforcement action. The task force has already worked with retailers to remove more than a dozen of these types of product listings online. â¢Masks. The only people who need masks are those who are already infected to keep from exposing others. The masks sold at drugstores aren't even good enough to truly protect anyone, Fauci said.""If you look at the masks that you buy in a drug store, the leakage around that doesn't really do much to protect you,"" he said. ""People start saying, 'Should I start wearing a mask?' Now, in the United States, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to wear a mask.""Fauci also doesn't want people to worry, but many are. Nancy Lamascus-Smith of Portland, Oregon, got an Amazon package delivered from China this month.""I jokingly asked my sister if I should be concerned,"" Lamascus-Smith said. ""Her reply was to wash my hands and stay away from her!""Ashley Nicole Pate, who lives near Huntsville, Alabama, also became worried when she received an Amazon package from China. Her concerns increased when she became sick a week later, so she went to the doctor to get tested for the flu. The test was negative and she was sent home with antibiotics for bronchitis.Fauci doesn't want people to worry about coronavirus, the danger of which is ""just minuscule."" But he does want them to take precautions against the ""influenza outbreak, which is having its second wave.""""We have more kids dying of flu this year at this time than in the last decade or more,"" he said. ""At the same time people are worrying about going to a Chinese restaurant. The threat is (we have) a pretty bad influenza season, particularly dangerous for our children.""Fauci offered advice for people who want to protect against the ""real and present danger"" of seasonal flu, which also would protect against the hypothetical danger of coronavirus.""Wash your hands as frequently as you can. Stay away from crowded places where people are coughing and sneezing. If in fact you are coughing and sneezing, cover your mouth,"" he says.""You know, all the things that we say each year.""",https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-retweets-call-to-fire-fauci-after-he-admits-earlier-lockdown-could-have-saved-lives/,1.0,263.56
